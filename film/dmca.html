        <p>This Site takes matters of Intellectual Property very seriously and is committed to meeting the needs of content owners while helping them manage publication of their content online. It should be noted that Dizigom.org is a simple search engine of videos available at a wide variety of third party websites.
            Any videos shown on third party websites are the responsibility of those sites and not Dizigom.com We have no knowledge of whether content shown on third party websites is or is not authorized by the content owner as that is a matter between the host site and the content owner. Dizigom.com does not host any content on its servers or network.
            Dizigom.com a pro-DMCA website and as such Content Owners can use the DMCA protocol to request removal of links to videos that they believe infringe their copyright.
            Content owners must understand that by having a link removed from Dizigom.org they will not be removing the actual source video from the 3rd party site. Content owners must contact the video hosting site themselves to request removal.
            Content owners must also understand that WatchTVEpisodes is a complex system of automatic indexers, robotic scripts and user submissions; if a video exists on the web we will at some point find it and index it. It is entirely possible that we will index a previously removed video that is hosted using a different URL or different hosting website. If this happens please let us know as per DMCA protocol and we will address the issue.
            Please do not send DMCA requests asking for entire channels, categories or shows to be removed. We only accept requests for an actual link to be removed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            If you wish to request multiple link removals please use just one DMCA notice but list all the URL’s in that request.
